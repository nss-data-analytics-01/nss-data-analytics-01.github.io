My background in sales and customer service gives me the perspective of what matters to both businesses and consumers, and marrying those skills with data analytics has allowed me to communicate complex ideas and information to a variety of audiences. I love crafting a story or metaphor to help someone understand what I'm trying to convey while unraveling the real value contained within a data set. I can not only work with the data, I can present the findings and bring value to both the enterprise and the final client.</p>",
